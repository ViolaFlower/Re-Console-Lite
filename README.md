Re-Console Lite is a massively debloated version of Re-Console, cutting the modpack down to about ~20 mods and a few resource packs.

It comes with the core features of Re-Console, but lacks some major features, such as:
- Mash-up packs
- OptiFine parity
- Old World Generation
- Tutorial Worlds


## üì• Installation Guide


**Please be sure to read Sodium's [Driver Compatibility](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/wiki/Driver-Compatibility) section on the wiki before installing Re-Console. It contains some important instructions on preventing crashes and other performance issues.**


There are multiple ways to install and experience Re-Console Lite.
### Modrinth Launcher (Recommended)
For the easiest possible installation, we recommend using the Modrinth Launcher. It's light, easy to use, reasonably quick, and only takes a few clicks to set up. Once you have it installed, you can install Re-Console Lite by searching for Re-Console Lite in the Modpacks section.
### Prism Launcher
Although more complicated, you can install Prism Launcher from their website. Prism is much more versatile and stronger as a launcher, but has a worse GUI. From there, add an instance and search for "Re-Console Lite" in the Modrinth section.

# üêõ How to Report Issues
Please use the issue tracker linked at the top of the page if you are experiencing bugs, crashes, or other issues. Be sure to include necessary information like your hardware/software (such as the GPU, CPU, modpack version, and OS) to help us identify and resolve issues.

# ‚úÖ Hardware Compatibility
Re-Console Lite, due to utilizing the powerful [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) mod, is only compatible with graphics cards that support ***OpenGL 4.5 or newer.***
Most graphics cards released in the past 12 years will meet these requirements, including the following:

  -  INTEL HD Graphics 500 Series (Skylake) or newer
  -  NVIDIA GeForce 400 Series (Fermi) or newer
  -  AMD Radeon HD 7000 Series (GCN 1) or newer

If you are running into problems, you should make sure that your graphics drivers are up-to-date. I also recommend taking a look at [this page](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium/wiki/Driver-Compatibility) on the Sodium wiki.

### ‚≠ê Legacy Console Edition accuracy
Re-Console Lite, like Re-Console, seeks to be accurate to an idea of "Legacy Console Edition if it never ended". This means the modpack does not seek to re-create old versions, but rather make LCE in the modern versions. It has titular features of LCE, including the crafting menu, gamma, creative menu and more!

### üöÄ Major performance improvement
Re-Console Lite is built off and kept in sync with [Adrenaline](https://modrinth.com/modpack/adrenaline) by [devin](https://modrinth.com/user/devin), the performance modpack officially endorsed by Sodium.
Re-Console Lite's goal is to significantly improve rendering and game logic performance, along with memory and hardware usage, without compromising on the game's looks or features in any way.
Re-Console Lite comes with all the features within [Adrenaline](https://modrinth.com/modpack/adrenaline), including;
- Improved rendering & game logic performance
- Improved memory and hardware usage
- Improved world generation speed


### ‚öôÔ∏è Open Source
Re-Console Lite is comprised of only open-source or source-available mods, which gives you the ability to see the code and contribute to the mods in the pack. Without mod developers hard work, Re-Console would not be possible. If you want to show the developers of these mods your appreciation, I encourage you to donate to them!
Re-Console is also available as a packwiz project on GitHub!

### üì© Up to Date
Re-Console Lite is usually one of the first modpacks to update in a stable state to new Minecraft versions.
